<H1> Watchlist for AS numbers </H1>
This is a little rundown of how to get a AS list and turn it into a way to look at all the AS numbers that your MDE machines are talking to.

There are many sources you can get the AS list from - ICANN being number one, but for the ease of getting a list I've got a list from IP2Location https://www.ip2location.com/ Signup is free and you can download the ASN file they have there for free.

Now, with that list we can create our watchlist of ASNs...
